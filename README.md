The [Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) Stack](http://sbolstack.org) is a platform for storing, sharing, and publishing synthetic biology designs using the [Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL)](http://sbolstandard.org).

To get started right away, we have provided a Docker image that contains a full SBOL Stack installation. Instructions on how to get up and running are provided [here](http://sbolstack.org/docs.html#installation). Alternatively, you can use our quick-start Amazon AWS image, which has an instance of the SBOL Stack pre-installed. 

To learn more about the SBOL Stack, including full installation instructions and API documentation, visit [sbolstack.org](http://sbolstack.org).

The SBOL Stack source code is split into four separate repositories:

* [SBOL Stack API](https://github.com/ICO2S/sbolstack-api) - Provides an abstraction over the Sesame RDF Triplestore with SBOL Stack functionality
* [Java Client Library](https://github.com/ICO2S/sbolstack-client-java) - Provides access to the SBOL Stack API from Java applications
* [JavaScript Client Library](https://github.com/ICO2S/sbolstack-frontend-js) - Provides access to the SBOL Stack API from JavaScript applications
* [SynBioHub](https://github.com/ICO2S/synbiohub) - Provides a Web-based frontend for browsing and updating an SBOL Stack instance
