<h1>What is the SBOL Stack?</h1>
<p>
The SBOL Stack is a Resource Description
Framework (RDF) database specifically designed for the storing and
publishing of <a href="http://www.sbolstandard.org/"
target="_blank">Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL)</a><sup>2</sup>
data. SBOL is an open-source standard for representing genetic
designs. It is actively being developed to facilitate the
electronic exchange and storage of designs as well as the embedding
of genetic designs in publications.

<p>
The SBOL Stack was developed by <a

<h1>What is the Stack used for?</h1>
<p>
The SBOL Stack
can be used to publish a library of synthetic parts and designs as
a service, to share SBOL with collaborators, and to store designs
of biological systems locally. Data in the SBOL Stack can be
accessed via a RESTful API where it can then be integrated into
CAD tools for building genetic designs. This web client contains an
interface for users to upload new biological data to the database,
to perform queries to access desired SBOL parts, and to download
SBOL and/or RDF data to a file. <br /> <br /> To facilitate
exchange, instances of the SBOL Stack can be installed at various
locations. Users can then register these different instances of the
SBOL Stack with their web client to perform federated queries over
all registered databases. These queries allow users to retrieve and
compile more complete data from multiple databases without the need
to manually query each repository individually. In addition, users
of the SBOL Stack will always have access to the most up-to-date
information on the parts they are querying. Instead of needing to
download information about a part when an update occurs, the SBOL
Stack automatically retrieves the updated data the next time a
query is made. The SBOL Stack can also register any Sesame RDF
database, so other repositories that contain information about
biological parts can be included in the federated queries.
